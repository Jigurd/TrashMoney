# TrashMoney

Made for and tested on a Samsung S7 running Android 8.0.0, and everything works properly on that device. 
If something is broken on another device, get in touch with me on discord (Jigurd#1092) and we can meet up
for a demo on my test device.

# Issues
None that I am aware of.

# Features outside of scope
None

# Other Notes
- Transactions are currently handled in the TransferActivty. This is because the original intention was the ability to perform multiple transactions while on that screen, but I was advised not to do this and stay with the specified behavior.
